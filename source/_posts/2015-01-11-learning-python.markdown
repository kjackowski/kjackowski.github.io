This is a list of free online books and other resources for anybody interested in learning the Python programming language. There are other lists out there, this one contains only items, that I have personally tried and found useful.

- [Codecademy][1]: A website with interactive tutorials.
- [PythonLearn][2]: A website and a book with videos and autograded exercises. It is the material used for the Coursera-course [Programming for Everybody][3] by Charles Severance.
- [Udacity: Intro to Computer Science & Programming CS 101][4]: A complete introduction to Computer Science with Python.
- [Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist][5]: A book that is also an introduction to Computer Science as well as an introduction to Python. If you have succeded in learning Python (at least to a reasonable degree), the author might still be of interest to you, there are some more advanced books on his website.
- [Learn Python The Hard Way][6]: A very good book about Python and Programming in general. Not really hard.
- Last but not least: [The Python Tutorial][7] - The official tutorial by Python.org.

Have fun!
