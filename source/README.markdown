# A blog, nothing less, nothing more

This is also the first post of my blog, which can be found here. [kjackowski.github.io][1].

## Intention

I created this personal blog to document my learning experiences in online courses. I have already taken some courses, but often strayed awy after some time. This is something I want to change in the new year 2015. Therefore: A Blog. Here I want to write about what I learned and what I struggle with. Since I will learn something about code, I will probably also post some things related to coding in general, not only about the courses, that I take part in.

## Technicalities

This blog is, as one can see on the [site][1] and in the [source code][2], is bu
ilt with [Octopress][3], a blogging software, that builds blogs with static html-files and can be easily configured to deploy on github.
